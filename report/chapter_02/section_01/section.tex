\section{Introduction} \label{sec:}

Temperature plays a crucial role in the \emph{germination} of the seeds. Different plants benefit
from different environments which having different \emph{temperature}. As it becomes a necessary to
maintain the temperature of the incubator inorder to encourage the germination and the growth
of the seedling. The \emph{thermal system} of the incubator aims to achieve this goal.

The \emph{thermal system} consists of mainly two parts, the temperature \emph{monitoring} part and the
temperature \emph{controlling} part. Further sections goes through the design and implementation
of these two parts.
