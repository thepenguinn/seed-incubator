\section{Temperature Monitoring System} \label{sec:}

For effectively controlling the indoor temperature of the Incubator, a \emph{paired} temperature
sensor would be essential. One will monitors the \emph{outdoor} temperature, as the other monitors
the \emph{indoor} temperature. From the output of each of these sensors, a \emph{relative} temperature
can be estimated and the \emph{heating and cooling system} can be tweaked accordingly.

        max width = \IGXMaxWidth,
        max height = \IGXMaxHeight,
        \IGXDefaultOptionalArgs,
    ] {tikzpics/endAbsThermalSensorSystem.pdf}

A DH22 sensor would be ideal as it can measure both the \emph{relative humidity} and \emph{temperature}.
The temperature can be in a range from $0^\circ$C to $100^\circ$C, with $\pm 0.5^\circ$C tolerance.
