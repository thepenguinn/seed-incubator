\section{Water and Fertilizer Reservoir Level Sensing} \label{sec:}

There are several ways to estimate the level of reservoir. One method is to
check \emph{continuity}. Another is to use an \emph{ultrasonic sensor} to estimate
the depth of the reservoir. The former method requires to have a conductive liquid.
And the latter method can cause false detection if the reservoir is not wide enough.
Another way is to use float switches to estimate water levels.

In the case of \emph{water reservoir} and \emph{fertilizer reservoir} we can use
a four level detector as shown in the figure.
