\section{Introduction} \label{sec:}

At the heart of EMCU, we need some controller to \emph{orchestrate} the entire
working of the \emph{incubator}. An ideal candidate would be readily available
\esp. As it is more powerful than other competing \emph{controllers} available
in the market. And has \emph{wireless} capabilities, such as WiFi and Bluetooth,
as it would ensure \emph{wireless} connectivity to the incubator. Following
sections will brief some of the capabilities that are relevant to our design.

\alertImportant{
    For more information about \esp, please consult the official documentation of
    \esp, as \esp is a feature packed device with a wide range of capabilities, and
    \emph{Espressif}\footnote{\label{fnt:espressif}the company that produces \esp.} had done a good
    job in providing a thorough documentation and a good set of toolchain that
    will enable get up going with the device.
