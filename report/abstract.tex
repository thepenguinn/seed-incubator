    The \textbf{Seed Incubation Plant} with \textbf{Environmental Monitoring and
    Control} attempts to optimize the \emph{germination} and \emph{growth
    process} of \emph{seeds} by providing a \emph{controlled} and
    \emph{monitored environment}.
    %%
    Manual methods are prone to \emph{human error}, requiring constant
    attention to environmental factors which can \emph{fluctuate} and
    \emph{adversely affect seed growth} and may lead to \emph{suboptimal
    results}.
    %%
    In most cases \emph{migrating} to an automated system is not
    \emph{economically feasible}, as it may require importing various
    equipments.Thus, an \emph{indigenous} implementation using a widely
    available \emph{controller} is an alternative solution.
    %%
    This system aims to realize the \emph{environment monitoring and control
    system} which will \emph{monitor} and \emph{control} various aspects that
    influence the optimal growth of the seedling, including \textbf{humidity},
    \textbf{temperature}, \textbf{lighting} and \textbf{soil moisture} by using ESP32
    \emph{microcontroller}. Wifi capabilities of ESP32 ensures
    the accumulation of collected data and presenting it to the user, visually.
    %%
    The solution not only tries to improve the \emph{efficiency} and the
    \emph{success rate of seed germination} but also tries to reduce the
    \emph{labour costs} and \emph{energy consumption}, hoping to offer a
    sustainable and reliable alternative to traditional incubation methods.
    %Thus, this implementation can potentially improve the \emph{crop yield} and
    %\emph{quality} significantly.
    %%
    %This ESP32 based system may offer \emph{better accuracy} and \emph{reliability} compared to
    %conventional greenhouse monitoring systems. It can potentially improve
    %crop yield and quality significantly and thus is an essential step towards
    %sustainable agriculture.

    %This project aims to design and implement
    %a \emph{low cost} and \emph{semi-automated}
    %\textbf{Seed Incubation Plant} based
    %on recent studies on \emph{Greenhouse
    %monitoring and control systems} using \textsc{ESP32}.
    %The most crucial part of a plant's life is the
    %period between when it was a seed and the stage
    %it becomes capable of surviving the outer world.
    %This period requires the at most care that the
    %plant can get. In most of the \emph{third world countries},
    %this \emph{incubation} process is still done \emph{manually}
    %by hand. In most cases migrating to an automated system is not
    %economically feasible, as it may require importing
    %various equipments. An \emph{indigenous} implementation
    %using a widely available controller is an alternative
    %solution, as this project is trying to provide.
    %This implementation aims to realize the \emph{atmosphere
    %monitoring and control system} which will
    %\emph{monitor} and \emph{control} various aspects
    %that influence the optimal growth of the seedling,
    %including \emph{humidity}, \emph{temperature},
    %\emph{lighting}, \emph{soil moisture} etc.
    %Wifi capabilities of ESP32 ensures the
    %accumulation of collected data and presenting
    %it to the user, visually.
    %This ESP32 based system offers better \emph{accuracy}
    %and \emph{reliability} compared to
    %\emph{conventional greenhouse monitoring systems}.
    %It can potentially improve crop \emph{yield} and \emph{quality}
    %significantly and thus is an essential step towards
    %sustainable agriculture.
