\section{Introduction} \label{sec:}

Following sections of this chapter showcases, the EMCU of the incubator. Currently only a
small part of the EMCU is built and the design can be further extended to add new features
such as air quality control\footnote{carbon dioxide, and oxygen monitoring and controlling
using the exhaust system}, soil pH monitoring, etc. This design can also be extended to
fully automated one, with automated planting, harvesting and remote monitoring.
