\section{Introduction} \label{sec:}

Before we begin, we need to get introduce ourselves with some of the \emph{conventions} that this
report follows. This chapter tries to build a \emph{strong foundation}, so the \emph{reader} could
get the most out of this document.


%With that,
%further sections also introduce some
%\emph{common circuits} used in this project.
