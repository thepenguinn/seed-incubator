\section{Light Monitoring System} \label{sec:}

There's two ways to detect \emph{light intensity} inside the incubator. One is
to use an array of LDR\footnote{Light Dependent Resistors.} or to use \emph{Esp
Cam} module to capture a picture and process the image to estimate the light
intensity. The former makes the hardware part a bit complicated and the latter
method requires to \emph{post process} the image to estimate the light
intensity. But latter method is preferable, because the cam can be used for
other things, such as estimating the \emph{growth} of the seedling\footnote{Even
though, it requires to train a model using TinyML, and would be hard to complete
the implementation, given the time constrain.}.
